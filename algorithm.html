<p>5.	Go to settings and select “<strong>API integrations</strong>” and select “<strong>Generate API key</strong>” </p>
<p>6.	Then send to me at: <a href="mailto:algorithm@greenisle.org">algorithm@greenisle.org</a> </p>
<p>(if you used Facebook, Google or Apple to sign up for capital.com send me the API key password as well)</p>
<p>7.	Put in money (minimum deposit is $20 and minimum withdrawal is $50)</p>
<h3>How to get paid:</h3>
<p>1.	At the end of the month you can withdraw a set amount if you chose to or you can reinvest the money - Email me at the end of the month to tell me if you want to withdraw the money or to keep it in</p>
<p>2.	To continue using the algorithm make sure to <a href ='https://GreenIsle.org/invoice'>pay me</a> - I <strong>WILL</strong> send you an invoice</p>
<p>At the end of the month you will be charged 2.5% of your account balance or $10 (whichever one is highest)</p>
